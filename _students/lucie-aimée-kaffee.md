One of the greatest barriers in accessing knowledge online is language. There is a tendency to provide information in one particular language which makes it hard for speakers of all other languages to access that same information.

A potential part of the solution can be linked data: if there were a central space, where concepts such as people, places, or events were translated into different languages and linked to other related concepts, it could have a huge impact on how the internet is translated. One of the language-independent knowledge bases that can help with this idea is Wikidata, which can be edited by humans and bots alike. 

To achieve a greater impact with multilingualism, there needs to be more data available in different languages. One of the possible ways of providing those is by the tools of knowledge base population. Additionally, this translated data can easily be used for multilingual natural language generation in order to the answer to questions in a question answering system.
