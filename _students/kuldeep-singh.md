The field of QA is so vast that the list of different QA systems can go long. Many QA systems based on specific domains have been developed. While many of these systems achieved significant performance for special use cases, a shortage was observed in all of them. We figured out that the existing QA systems suffer from the following drawbacks: (1) potential of reusing its components is very weak, (2) extension of the components is problematic, and (3) interoperability between the employed components are not systematically defined. Therefore, there is a need for a descriptive approach that defines a conceptual view of QA systems. This approach must cover all the needs of current QA systems and be abstracted from implementation details. Moreover, it must be open such that it can be used in future QA systems. The generalized approach for architecture or ontology of a QA system and semantic search must focus to bring all state-of-the-art advancements of QA under a single umbrella. We envisioned that a generalized vocabulary for QA will be an abstraction level on top of all the existing QA approaches and will provide interoperability and exchangeability between them. This generalized vocabulary can be further used to integrate different components and web services within a QA system. For this, we have developed a message driven vocabulary to promote interoperability of Question answering Systems. This paper got accepted in ICSC 2016. This is now acting as a foundation step for further research to promote reusability of QA components in our current work. Furthermore, a vocabulary driven methodology for integrating heterogeneous QA components named Qanary has been developed. The work had been published in ESWC 2016 with its extension accepted in ICWE. This work is extended to create the Qanary ecosystem with independent QA components integrated in Qanary architecture. While integrating components in Qanary ecosystem, it has been observed that user need to put lot of manual work to create a QA pipeline. To solve this problem, QAestro, an ontology based approach for orchestrating QA components has been developed and accepted in Dexa 2017.
