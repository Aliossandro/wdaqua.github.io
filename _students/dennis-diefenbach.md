To identify the technologies to build the core component of the QA system, we first analysed the state-of-the-art in this field. This led to writing a survey paper that was submitted to the Knowledge and Information Systems with the collaboration of Vanessa Lopez from the IBMâ€™s Dublin Research Laboratory in Ireland. After this, the work was focused on two directions: First, to create a framework, called Qanary, that allows to reuse and combine technologies that are already used in QA system. This was done in collaboration with Kuldeep Singh (ESR 8) from the WDAqua project (FRAUNHOFER) and led to two publications at two conferences: ICSC 2016 and ESWC 2016 and a submission to ICWE 2017. Moreover a speech recognition system proposed by Ashwini Kumar (ESR 9) was integrated in the Qanary framework.  

Second, considering the lessons learned from previous question answering systems, we are building a new question answering system using new technologies. This led to a submission to the WIMS 2016 conference, and a collaboration with the AKSW research group at the University of Leipzig. The QA system is continuously under development, the current version can be found at www.wdaqua.eu/qa. Currently it can query Dbpedia and Wikidata using natural language questions and keywords. Moreover it is possible to query Wikidata using english, french, german and italian.

To expose the results a user interface was build. This work was done in the framework of an internship where, Shanzay Amjad, a student from the university of Ottawa was hired. A disambiguation interface was added in collaboration with Niousha Hormozi (ESR 12). An evaluation of the user interface is planned together with Laura Koesten (ESR 15).
