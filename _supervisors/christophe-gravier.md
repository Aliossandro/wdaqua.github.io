I received a PhD from Université Saint-Etienne in 2007, after a CS Master degree from INSA Lyon, and a French engineer diploma from Télécom Saint-Etienne. Since approximately 2010, my research has somehow shifted away from online engineering.
My main research interests today at SATIN research team focus on Web information extraction, Social and Semantic Web, and their applications for Cloud Computing, Big Data, and Multimedia.
