Antoine Zimmermann graduated from the École Nationnale Supérieure d'Informatique et de Mathématiques Appliquées de Grenoble (ENSIMAG) and got a Master of Science from the Université Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France. He hold a Doctorate in Computer Science from Université Joseph Fourier, where he defended in October 2008. Between February 2009 and September 2010, he worked at the Digital Enterprise Research Institute (now Insight NUI Galway), at the National University of Ireland, Galway. Between October 2010 and August 2011, he was a lecturer at Institut Nationale de Sciences Appliquées de Lyon (INSA Lyon) and a researcher at Laboratoire d'InfoRmatique en Image et Système d'information (LIRIS). Since September 2011, he is teaching at École des Mines de Saint-Étienne and is a member of Institut Henri Fayol. He conducts his research in Laboratoire Hubert Curien as part of the research group Connected Intelligence.

His research interests are related to knowledge representation and reasoning in open, decentralised environments such as the World Wide Web, where the notion of context of information is key. This leads him to investigate the fields of contextual reasoning, annotated logics, reasoning with provenance, time, uncertainty, fuzziness, access control; the Semantic Web, the Web of data, Linked Data, open data. Antoine is a believer in open standards and has participated in W3C standardisation groups.
