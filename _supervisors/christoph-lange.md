Dr Christoph Lange is the head of the Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) department at the Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems IAIS and a senior researcher leading the Semantic Data Management group within the Smart Data Analytics (SDA) research group at the University of Bonn, Germany. He has been working with both institutions since 2013. In 2011, he received a Ph.D. from Jacobs University Bremen, Germany, for enabling collaboration on semiformal mathematical knowledge by semantic web integration.

His research is broadly concerned with representing expressive knowledge in complex domains in a formal but scalable way using linked (open) data, which enables and facilitates machine support with retrieval, analysis, quality assessment, publishing, collaborative authoring, etc.; results have been published in high-profile international journals and conferences (h-index 18 according to Google Scholar).

Application domains range from research infrastructures to enterprise information integration. The latter has been subject of contractual R&D for several German enterprises, including a leading automotive parts manufacturer. On semantic web and intelligent computer mathematics topics, Christoph Lange has organised numerous conferences, challenges, trainings and workshops, co-supervised 10 PhD students, taught lectures and coordinated lab and seminar classes, served as an expert for several international funding bodies and contributed to international OMG and W3C standards.
